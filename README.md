# Estimation and Inference in Cluster-Based Predictive Local Unit Root Regression using Permutation Methods

## Description (Work-in-Progress)

In this paper we extend the methodology proposed in the R package [‘PermLURM’](https://github.com/christiskatsouris/PermLURM) (see, also ['ivxPredictive'](https://github.com/christiskatsouris/ivxPredictive)) in order to develop a robust econometric framework for estimation and inference purposes in Cluster-Based Predictive Local Unit Root Regression Models. Furthermore, emphasis is given in the estimation of covariance matrices under network or cluster dependence as well as in dealing with short-memory versus long-memory processes under abstract degree of persistence.
